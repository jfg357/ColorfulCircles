# Java FX Tutorial
## About This Tutorial
  This collection of tutorials is designed to get you started with common JavaFX tasks, including working with layouts, controls, style sheets, and visual effects.
## 1 Hello World, JavaFX Style
  The best way to teach you what it is like to create and build a JavaFX application is with a “Hello World” application. An added benefit of this tutorial is that it enables you to test that your JavaFX technology is properly installed.

  The tool used in this tutorial is NetBeans IDE 7.3. Before you begin, ensure that the version of NetBeans IDE that you are using supports JavaFX 2. See the System Requirements for details.
## 2 Creating a Form in JavaFX
  Creating a form is a common activity when developing an application. This tutorial teaches you the basics of screen layout, how to add controls to a layout pane, and how to create input events.
## 3 Fancy Forms with JavaFX CSS
  This tutorial is about making your JavaFX application look attractive by adding a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS). You develop a design, create a .css file, and apply the new styles.
  
  In this tutorial, you will take a Login form that uses default styles for labels, buttons, and background color, and, with a few simple CSS modifications, turn it into a stylized application.

## 4 Using FXML to Create a User Interface
  This tutorial shows the benefits of using JavaFX FXML, which is an XML-based language that provides the structure for building a user interface separate from the application logic of your code.
  
  If you started this document from the beginning, then you have seen how to create a login application using just JavaFX. Here, you use FXML to create the same login user interface, separating the application design from the application logic, thereby making the code easier to maintain.

## 5 Animation and Visual Effects in JavaFX
  You can use JavaFX to quickly develop applications with rich user experiences. In this Getting Started tutorial, you will learn to create animated objects and attain complex effects with very little coding.

## 6 Deploying Your First JavaFX Application
   This topic shows how to deploy the samples from any of the Getting Started with JavaFX tutorials.
   
   If you develop your JavaFX application in NetBeans IDE, it is packaged automatically and is easy to deploy.
